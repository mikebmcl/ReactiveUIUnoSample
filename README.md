### Notes on modifications (MikeBMcL)

This is just a derivative of the Uno sample linked above. It is not official or endorsed by ReactiveUI nor any person or 
organization affiliated with it. It does not include any of the other samples. It adds a small amount of functionality and a 
bunch of explanatory comments and links. Like the sample it derives from, it is licensed under the MIT License, which can be found 
in the LICENSE file accompanying this. I do not claim that anything in my changes represent good practices or are suitable for use 
by anyone for anything. They're probably fine, but I'm not a ReactiveUI expert. Lastly, this has not been tested on iOS, MacOS,
or Tizen, so it may not work correctly, or at all, on those platforms.
